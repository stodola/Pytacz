My first application

I used similar application in windows environment. When I switched to using linux, I was unable to use that app, because it was enclose in exe extensiton file. So I decided to write this app from scratch.

This application works in following way. In the same directory where app is kept, user have to put .txt files in following form:

question__ 
answer__
(empty line)__
question__
answer__
(empty line)__
...__

Txt file is loaded to the application using combobox button placed at the top of application.
When file is loaded according to the described instructions, user will be able to use all functionality of the program.
